To create a new React application, you can use the create-react-app command-line tool. Here's the step-by-step process:

First, make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine. You can check this by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal. If these commands return a version number, you're good to go. If not, you'll need to install Node.js and npm first.

Install create-react-app globally on your machine. This is a package provided by Facebook to help bootstrap new React applications.

Use create-react-app to create a new React application.

Here's the code:
# Step 1: Check Node.js and npm versions
node -v
npm -v

# Step 2: Install create-react-app
npm install -g create-react-app

# Step 3: Create a new React application
npx create-react-app my-app

Replace my-app with the name you want for your new application. After running these commands, you'll have a new directory with the same name as your application, filled with a basic React application structure. You can start the application by navigating into the directory and running npm start.
